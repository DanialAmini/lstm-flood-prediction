# A Recurrent Neural Network Exploration
This is an exploration to determine the appropriateness of LSTM Neural Networks for ahead-of-time flood level prediction.
No data for the rain is included, I wanted to test if the LSTM network can follow the general pattern of the flood levels based on historical data alone.
